This repository is just a collection of snippets that I find interesting, hard or troublesome. 

Initially I used it to store snippets that I couldn't exactly wrap my head around. But later I started using it to
type any interesting snippet that I've encountered and experiment/toy with it. 

Some of those snippets aren't even hard, they might be simply elegant, useful or whatever.
